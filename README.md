Colatto is a decentralized and open source no loss lottery platform. Our aim is to gamify DEFI space and support them by making users stick more to the protocols through the gamification layer. We are a middle layer which introduces gamification for increasing user stickiness and satisfying them with rewards at the same time. 

Our Core Values:
Users who stay with us for long time, we make sure they have more chance to earn reward as they are helping to build a good web3 defi space
Elevate defi space and help protocols in getting loyal users who are going to stick to platforms

Why “no loss lottery”?
No-loss lottery represents a paradigm shift in finance, where financial incentives of stakeholders are aligned in a decentralized way and participants are in a win-win situation
Winning the lottery confers great financial rewards, and not winning the lottery is also beneficial since they are rewarded

Why Colatto? 
Our algorithm makes sure everyone is treated fairly and people who stick longer on the platform will have increase in the probability of winning(effective amount concept)
We provide an additional layer of rewards to users who are on the platform for a long time like NFT’s(this is also done randomly and our NFT is a utility token too which has a value on our platform) 
We ourselves have been using lottery platforms for quite some time to study about user experience. We have studied many lottery platforms like Pool Together and Moonpot, by extensively studying and investing in it, we know what is the issue the users face, which Colatto is trying to solve.

Where does the prize money come from? Behind the scenes we invest the money in a lending and borrowing pool which helps us earn interest then which is distributed among winners of the lottery decided using VRF(Verifiable random function). Every Colatto lottery is linked to one lending and borrowing platform. 

How many lottery can one participate? Are there any restrictions? You can take part in as many lottery games as you want. There are no restrictions made by us, but our algorithm decides what is the max amount and min amount one can provide in the lottery as it changes based on the underlying system(Will explain more in Yellow Paper).  

Is there any locking period? No, there is no locking period, but you have to pay certain fees(2%) if you want to withdraw before the lottery announcement and you will not be eligible for rewards. Fees decrease with time. e.g. Assume a lottery is running every Sunday, if you deposit money on Tuesday and withdraw on Friday, you have to pay a fee (less than 2%, as you have spent some time in the lottery) and you won’t be eligible for rewards.


How winners are decided? How fair is it? Colatto is decentralized and open source which means any one can take a look at smart contracts and audit it. We are using Chainlink VRF(Verifiably Random Function). The ChainLink VRF ensures that winners are chosen in a verifiably random way.

Executive Summary
The executive summary is another opportunity to grab readers’ attention and convince them your whitepaper is worth their time. Spend time developing a concise and hard-hitting abstract.
We request our users to read this white paper thoroughly so that they understand the system better and take good decisions.
How is the winning probability decided for a user?
We calculate the effective amount deposited by a user and it is one of the parameters that affect probability. Assume lottery started on 1 May 2022 and on every 7 days after lottery results are declared, let’s see what is probability over the date 21st May 2022 assuming no on among  has won on 7th May and 14th May, when 3 people are entering lottery in different time
 
User
Amount Deposited
Date of participation
Effective amount (21st May)
Probability 
(21st May)
Comment
Michael 
400$
1st May
400*3 = 1200$
1200/total_amount
Michael has more probability even when he invested 400$, as he is on platform longer than other 2
Josh
500$
8th May
500*2 = 1000 $
1000/total_amount
Andrew
1000$
15th May
1000 *1 = 1000 $
1000/total_amount

We will have the dashboard which will show users what the probability of winning is and how it is increasing. We want to reward users who are sticking to our platform, but in an unbiased way. 
We reset the effective amount for the user once he/she wins. Example: Assume Michael won on 21st May so now probability on 28th May is
User
Amount Deposited
Date of participation
Effective amount (28st May)
Probability 
(28st May)
Comment
Michael
(Won on 21st May) 
400$
1st May
400*(1) = 400$
400/total_amount
Michael's probability has been set back to 1 again after his winning.


Josh
500$
8th May
500*3 = 1000$
1500/total_amount
Andrew
1000$
15th May
1000*2 = 1000$
2000/total_amount



Note: This is just one of the parameters which will impact probability, our NFT is something which also impacts probability.


Why do we invest in lending protocols?

We are trying to elevate lending and borrowing defi space

What are the additional NFT rewards for users?

For loyal users we randomly select few users who have not won lottery in long time and provide them NFT which they can in turn use to increase probability of win, and they can also trade it for money in market place if they don’t want to use it
This NFT can additionally increase probability by 1x-10x times

If a user is in the lottery for a long time and has NFT then time will come when he will win for sure?
Yes, but we cap the max probability to keep the chance of game, e.g. the cap can be 0.5 for example after that probability of winning will not increase, and once he/she wins it will reset back to new calculation. 

Our lottery platform is fair for everyone and at the same time takes into account users who are using our platform more. As the user who has provided funds for a long time is helping other users earn rewards, which is why we want to keep loyal users happy but based on randomness as well :)
